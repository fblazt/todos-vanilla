## About

Todos is a Web App that can be used to organize your to-do or task list.

## Technical Documentation

Todos Web App is an app that built based on MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework by JavaScript. Each of this parts handles its own task and functions. 

Looking at the app folder structure, there is view.js file that will renders the view to the user, and communicating with controller.js file.

And from controller.js, it will connect the view.js and model.js, making the view updated with the database.

The model.js is the one that connected to the local database, updating the data by trigger from store.js.

Store.js is the file that use to control the database, the database used for this project is browser's localStorage. The data that saved to localStorage is JSON data using the stringify() method, and can be read  or parsed back by using parse() method from JSON.

While template.js is the file that connected to the HTML element and update each element following the trigger from all of the function above.
